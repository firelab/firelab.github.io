The Fire, Fuel, and Smoke Science Program (FFS) of the Rocky Mountain Research Station is located primarily at the Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, Montana. The Programâ€™s scientists, technicians, and support staff conduct national and international, cutting-edge work in wildland fire research. They conduct research and develop management tools and applications designed to improve understanding of wildland fire and increase the safety and effectiveness of fire, fuel, and smoke management. Specific research activities are focused on physical fire processes, fuel dynamics, smoke emissions and dispersion, fire ecology, fire and fuel management strategies, and science synthesis and delivery.
